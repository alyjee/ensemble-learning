# **DEEPFILL**

Make sure to change `runtime` in colab to GPU for quick results!

**NOTE**

- The inpainting is being done after resizing the image to 512x512. This can be changed in the RESIZE_TO parameter in the _config.py_ file.
- An example of an image and corresponding mask is present in the _example_ folder of the repo. The notebook also allows generation of random masks. The uploaded image and the masks will be present in the _input_ folder.
- This repo has not been tested for training. Inference works fine.

Check it out and let me know if any issues!
